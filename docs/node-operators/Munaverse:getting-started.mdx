# Getting Started

Welcome to Mina! 

Get started setting up a Mina node, learn how to generate a keypair for use with the network, connect to the network, and begin producing blocks.

This documentation is for the **Mainnet** release.

## Requirements

**Software**: Supported environments include macOS, Linux (Debian 10, 11, 12 and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS), and any host machine with Docker. 

**Processor**: Only AMD64 CPU architecture is supported.

**Hardware**: Sending and receiving MINA does not require any special hardware. 

Running a block producer on the Mina network requires at least:

- 8-core processor
- 16 GB of RAM

More RAM is required to run a SNARK worker node at the same time as a block producer.

**Network**: At least 1 Mbps connection

**VM Instances**:

O(1) Labs has tested running nodes on several cloud providers. We recommend the following instances for basic node operator needs. Custom requirements and different cost constraints might require a different instance type.

- AWS [c5.2xlarge](https://www.ec2instances.info/?filter=c5.2xl&region=us-west-2&cost_duration=daily&selected=c5.2xlarge)
- GCP [c2-standard-8](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types)
- Azure [Standard_F8s_v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-compute#fsv2-series-1)
- Digital Ocean [c-8-16gib](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?size=c-8-16gib)

## Installation

To install the latest [Mainnet **Stable** Release 1.4.0](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases/tag/1.4.0), use the installation steps for your environment.

The binary download is around 1 GB, so the installation might take a few minutes.

To discover and install pre-release (Beta) builds, see the [Mina Releases](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases) page on GitHub.

### Ubuntu and Debian

To set up the new Debian `stable` repository and install the latest binary version:

```
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.o1test.net $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl unzip mina-mainnet=1.4.0-c980ba8
```

To verify the mina daemon installation, run:

- `mina version`

The expected output is `Commit c980ba87c3417f40a7081225dfe7478c5ee70fd7 on branch master`.

### Windows
Windows is not natively supported. Instead, use the [Docker instructions](getting-started#docker). 

If you are interested in receiving a grant to develop Mina for Windows, email grants@o1labs.org or reach out in the [Mina Protocol Discord server](https://discord.gg/minaprotocol).

### macOS

macOS is used by developers and is not officially supporting any pre-built packages.

Instead, use the Docker instructions or build from source.

### Docker

Docker is a cross-platform tool. You can download and install Docker on multiple platforms. 

Use the Docker installation instructions for your platform on [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). After Docker is installed, follow the [Connect to the Mina Network](/node-operators/connecting-to-the-network#docker) instructions.

### Build from source

On Linux or macOS operating systems, you can experiment with [Building Mina](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/master/README-dev.md#building-mina) from source code.

Other operating systems haven't been tested thoroughly and might have issues. You can share logs and get troubleshooting help in the [Mina Protocol Discord server](https://discord.gg/minaprotocol).

## Set up port forwarding and firewalls

If you are running a firewall, you must allow traffic on TCP port 8302.

Unless the `-external-ip YOUR_IP` flag is provided, the daemon uses HTTPS (443) and HTTP (80) to determine its own IP address.

Enable port forwarding on your router to allow inbound traffic to the following ports through your **external** IP address:

- TCP port `8302`
- To use the GraphQL service, expose TCP port `3085`

## Next

Now that you've installed mina and configured your network, you can move on to the next step: [generating a keypair](generating-a-keypair).
